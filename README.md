# ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **machine learning regression task** using the Kaggle **Bluebook for Bulldozers** dataset.  
The goal is to predict the **future sale price of bulldozers** given their characteristics and historical sales data.

---

## ðŸ›  Approach

### 1. Problem Definition
How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of similar bulldozer sales?

---

### 2. Data
The dataset comes from Kaggleâ€™s [Bluebook for Bulldozers Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers).  

The competition provides three datasets:
- **Train.csv** â†’ Training set (data through the end of 2011)  
- **Valid.csv** â†’ Validation set (January 1, 2012 â€“ April 30, 2012)  
- **Test.csv** â†’ Test set (May 1, 2012 â€“ November 2012, used for final leaderboard)  

A **data dictionary** is also provided by Kaggle and can be found in the `data/` folder.

---

### 3. Evaluation
The official evaluation metric is **RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error)** between the actual and predicted auction prices.

Mathematically:

\[
RMSLE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} ( \log(y_i + 1) - \log(\hat{y_i} + 1))^2 }
\]

Where:
- \(y_i\) = actual sale price  
- \(\hat{y_i}\) = predicted sale price

### 4. Features
The dataset contains a variety of features related to bulldozer sales, including:
- **SalesID** â€“ Unique identifier  
- **SalePrice** â€“ Target variable (what we want to predict)  
- **MachineID** â€“ Unique machine identifier  
- **ModelID** â€“ Unique model identifier  
- **YearMade** â€“ Year the bulldozer was made  
- **ProductGroup** â€“ Category of the bulldozer  
- **Enclosure, Hydraulics, Engine details** â€“ Machine specifications  
- **SaleDate** â€“ Date of sale  

For a detailed explanation, refer to the **data dictionary** provided in the dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Handling missing values  
3. Feature engineering (parsing dates, categorical encoding, extracting useful features)  
4. Model selection (Baseline â†’ Random Forest â†’ other regressors)  
5. Training and evaluation using **RMSLE**  
6. Hyperparameter tuning  
7. Final model deployment
